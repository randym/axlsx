    # Active Pane
    # The pane that is active.
    # Options are 
    #  * bottom_left:  Bottom left pane, when both vertical and horizontal
    #                  splits are applied. This value is also used when only
    #                  a horizontal split has been applied, dividing the pane

    #  * bottom_right: Bottom right pane, when both vertical and horizontal
    #                  splits are applied.
    #  * top_left:     Top left pane, when both vertical and horizontal splits
    #                  are applied. This value is also used when only a horizontal 
    #                  split has been applied, dividing the pane into upper and lower
    #                  regions. In that case, this value specifies the top pane.
    #                  This value is also used when only a vertical split has
    #                  been applied, dividing the pane into right and left
    #                  regions. In that case, this value specifies the left pane
    #  * top_right:    Top right pane, when both vertical and horizontal
    #                  splits are applied. This value is also used when only
    #                  a vertical split has been applied, dividing the pane 
    #                  into right and left regions. In that case, this value

    # Split State
    # Indicates whether the pane has horizontal / vertical

    #                  this state, when the panes are unfrozen again, a single
    #                  pane results, with no split. In this state, the split 
    #                  bars are not adjustable.
    #  * frozen_split: Panes are frozen and were split before being frozen. In
    #                  this state, when the panes are unfrozen again, the split
    #                  remains, but is adjustable.
    #  * split:        Panes are split, but not frozen. In this state, the split
    #                  bars are adjustable by the user.
