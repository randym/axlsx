  # The Shared String Table class is responsible for managing and serializing common strings in a workbook.
  # While the ECMA-376 spec allows for both inline and shared strings it seems that at least some applications like iWorks Numbers
  # and Google Docs require that the shared string table is populated in order to interoperate properly.
  # As a developer, you should never need to directly work against this class. Simply set 'use_shared_strings'
  # on the package or workbook to generate a package that uses the shared strings table instead of inline strings.
  # @note Serialization performance is affected by using this serialization method so if you do not need interoperability
  # it is recomended that you use the default inline string method of serialization.
