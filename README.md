If you are working in rails, or with active record see:
* http://github.com/randym/acts_as_xlsx
acts_as_xlsx is a simple ActiveRecord mixin that lets you generate a workbook with:

    ```ruby
    Posts.where(created_at > Time.now-30.days).to_xlsx
    ```

Axlsx_Rails provides an Axlsx renderer so you can move all your spreadsheet code from your controller into view files. Partials are supported so you can organize any code into reusable chunks (e.g. cover sheets, common styling, etc.) You can use it with acts_as_xlsx, placing the to_xlsx call in a view and add ':package => xlsx_package' to the parameter list. Now you can keep your controllers thin!

There are guides for using axlsx and acts_as_xlsx here:

The examples directory contains a number of more specific examples as
well.

Synopsis
--------

Axlsx is an Office Open XML Spreadsheet generator for the Ruby programming language.
With Axlsx you can create excel worksheets with charts, images (with links), automated and fixed column widths, customized styles, functions, tables, conditional formatting, print options, comments, merged cells, auto filters, file and stream serialization  as well as full schema validation. Axlsx excels at helping you generate beautiful Office Open XML Spreadsheet documents without having to understand the entire ECMA specification.

Feature List
------------

**1. Author xlsx documents: Axlsx is made to let you easily and quickly generate professional xlsx based reports that can be validated before serialization.

**2. Generate 3D Pie, Line, Scatter and Bar Charts: With Axlsx chart generation and management is as easy as a few lines of code. You can build charts based off data in your worksheet or generate charts without any data in your sheet at all. Customize gridlines, label rotation and series colors as well.

**3. Custom Styles: With guaranteed document validity, you can style borders, alignment, fills, fonts, and number formats in a single line of code. Those styles can be applied to an entire row, or a single cell anywhere in your workbook.

**4. Automatic type support: Axlsx will automatically determine the type of data you are generating. In this release Float, Integer, String, Date, Time and Boolean types are automatically identified and serialized to your spreadsheet.

**5. Automatic and fixed column widths: Axlsx will automatically determine the appropriate width for your columns based on the content in the worksheet, or use any value you specify for the really funky stuff.

**6. Support for automatically formatted 1904 and 1900 epochs configurable in the workbook.

**7. Add jpg, gif and png images to worksheets with hyperlinks

**8. Reference cells in your worksheet with "A1" and "A1:D4" style references or from the workbook using "Sheet1!A3:B4" style references

**9. Cell level style overrides for default and customized style objects

**10. Support for formulas, merging, row and column outlining as well as
cell level input data validation.

**12. Auto filtering tables with worksheet.auto_filter as well as support for Tables

**13. Export using shared strings or inline strings so we can inter-op with iWork Numbers (sans charts for now).

**14. Output to file or StringIO

**15. Support for page margins and print options

**16. Support for password and non password based sheet protection.

**17. First stage interoperability support for GoogleDocs, LibraOffice,
and Numbers

# Known interoperability issues.
As axslx implements the Office Open XML (ECMA-376 spec) much of the
functionality is interoperable with other spreadsheet software. Below is
a listing of some known issues.

1. Libra Office
   -  You must specify colors for your series. see examples/chart_colors.rb
for an example.
   - You must use data in your sheet for charts. You cannot use hard coded
values.
   -  Chart axis and gridlines do not render. I have a feeling this is
related to themes, which axlsx does not implement at this time.

2. Google Docs
   - Images are known to not work with google docs
   - border colors do not work

3. Numbers
   - you must set 'use_shared_strings' to true
   - charts do not render
